# PHP Practitioner

This project is a simple PHP application that demonstrates the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. It includes a basic user authentication system with features like sign up, sign in, and password reset.

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

This project heavily utilizes OOP concepts to structure the code in a modular and maintainable way. Here are some of the key OOP principles you'll find in this project:

- **Classes and Objects**: The project is divided into classes like `User`, `Database`, `Router`, and `Request`, each representing a specific entity or functionality.
- **Encapsulation**: Each class encapsulates its own data and methods, hiding the internal implementation details from the outside world.
- **Inheritance**: While not explicitly used in this project, the structure allows for easy extension through inheritance.
- **Polymorphism**: The router component demonstrates polymorphism by handling different types of requests and routing them to the appropriate controllers.
